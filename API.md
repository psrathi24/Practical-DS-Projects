What is an API call (answer in your own words)?
A request made by a client to a server to retrieve, send, or process data. It allows applications to communicate with each
other through predefined endpoints.

What is an example we discussed to create an API call locally?
Used FastAPI and tested with cURL.

What is an example we discussed to create an API call on the cloud? 
Used a lambda function and AWS Gateway.

What is the difference between FastAPI and creating API from AWS Gateway?
FastAPI is a Python framework for locally developing APIs and hosting them on cloud platforms. It provides built-in validation, asynchronous handling, and flexible development features.
AWS API Gateway is a fully managed service for deploying APIs in the cloud, handling authentication, rate limiting, and integrations with AWS Lambda or backend services.

In your own words after watching the video, what are the main steps to create an API call on AWS Gateway?
1. Define an API in AWS API Gateway.
2. Configure endpoints, methods, and request/response mappings.
3. Integrate with AWS Lambda or another backend.
4. Deploy the API and set up authentication mechanisms.
5. Test and monitor the API using AWS tools

Professionally in the industry, how does developers ship product from one team to another? What's the usage of API here?
Developers use CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and cloud hosting services. APIs enable seamless data exchange, service integrations, and standardized interactions between microservices, allowing different components to communicate effectively across environments.
